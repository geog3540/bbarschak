         <p class="card-text"> This flow map is displaying the exports, gross amount,
           and flow total of the banana trade throughout South America. I decided
            to change my datas classes in multiple ways throughout the making of this
          map. For the Export total I used 5 classes to allow for a wider range between the countries
        This was to show which countries are the leaders in banana production and who falls short of them.
      For the Nodes I went with only three classes to show who is moving and gaining the most bananas throughout the country
    with an emphasis on high, meidum, and low values. For the flow map I went with a blue to red
  color scheme to really get a good contrast between the large flows of bananas to the small flows.
By looking at the map you can see the countries with the largest banana product are Ecuador, and Bolvia
These two countries rank higher than the others with totals of over 100,000 for Bolvia and over 400,000 for Ecuador.
However, the total flow for Bolvia is very low meaning that they are not selling many bananas within their continent.
On the Other hand Ecuador and Argentina are eadingt the way with high sales for Ecuador and high imports for Argentina.
You can see with the flow arrows that Argentina along with Chile are bringing in many bananas while they have low grow counts.
Alot of flows are heading to the southern regions probably due to lack of a suitable growing environment in these countries. As well as Chile
having a mostly mountainous climate even though they have regions that reach toward the established banana growing country of Bolivia. </p>
